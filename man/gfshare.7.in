.SH NAME
gfshare - explanation of Shamir Secret Sharing in gf(2**8)
.SH SYNOPSIS
In simple terms, this package provides a library for implementing the
sharing of secrets and two tools for simple use-cases of the algorithm.
The library implements what is known as Shamir's method for secret sharing
in the Galois Field 2**8.
In slightly simpler words, this is N-of-M secret-sharing byte-by-byte.
Essentially this allows us to split a secret S into any M shares
S(1) to S(M) such that any N of those shares can be used to reconstruct S
but any less than N shares yields no information whatsoever.
